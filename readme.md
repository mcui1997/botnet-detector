# IoT Botnet Detection: Machine Learning vs Deep Learning Comparison

## Project Overview

This project implements and compares traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches for detecting IoT botnet behavior in network traffic. The system provides a complete pipeline for training both model types on the same dataset and evaluating their performance on unseen data to determine which approach better generalizes to new attack patterns.

## Research Objective

To empirically compare the effectiveness of feature engineering-based machine learning versus raw data processing deep learning for cybersecurity threat detection in IoT network environments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dataset Setup (Required First Step)

**This application requires the UNSW 2018 IoT Botnet Dataset to function.** The datasets are not included in this repository due to their large size (1GB+ each).

### Step 1: Download the Dataset

1. **Visit the official dataset page:** https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/personal/z5131399_ad_unsw_edu_au/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fz5131399_ad_unsw_edu_au%2FDocuments%2FBot-IoT_Dataset%2FDataset%2FEntire%20Dataset&ga=1

2. **Download required files:**
   - `UNSW_2018_Iot_Botnet_Dataset_2.csv` (Primary training dataset - recommended)
   - `UNSW_2018_Iot_Botnet_Dataset_3.csv` (For testing - optional)
   - `UNSW_2018_Iot_Botnet_Dataset_4.csv` (For testing - optional)

3. **Alternative option:** You can use any of the numbered datasets (1-10), but you'll need to modify the file path in the code.

### Step 2: Set Up Directory Structure

Create the following folder structure in your project directory:

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data_handler.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ml_models.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dl_models.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model_comparison.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate_datasets.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ training_datasets/          ‚Üê Create this folder
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UNSW_2018_Iot_Botnet_Dataset_2.csv  ‚Üê Place downloaded file here
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing_datasets/           ‚Üê Create this folder
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UNSW_2018_IoT_Botnet_Dataset_3.csv  ‚Üê Optional test files
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UNSW_2018_IoT_Botnet_Dataset_4.csv  ‚Üê Optional test files
```

### Step 3: Configure File Path (If Using Different Dataset)

If you downloaded a different dataset file (e.g., Dataset_1.csv instead of Dataset_2.csv), update the file path in `data_handler.py`:

```python
# Line ~21 in data_handler.py
dataset_path = "training_datasets/UNSW_2018_Iot_Botnet_Dataset_2.csv"

# Change to your downloaded file:
dataset_path = "training_datasets/UNSW_2018_Iot_Botnet_Dataset_1.csv"  # Example
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dataset Format Requirements
The system expects CSV files with exactly 35 columns in this order:
```
pkSeqID,stime,flgs,proto,saddr,sport,daddr,dport,pkts,bytes,state,ltime,seq,dur,mean,stddev,
res_bps_payload,res_pps_payload,res_bps_ratio,res_pps_ratio,ar_bps_payload,ar_pps_payload,
ar_bps_ratio,ar_pps_ratio,ar_bps_delta,trans_depth,response_body_len,ct_srv_src,ct_srv_dst,
ct_dst_ltm,ct_src_ltm,ct_src_dport_ltm,ct_dst_sport_ltm,category,subcategory
```

### Methodology Differences

**Machine Learning Approach:**
- Heavy feature engineering and mathematical transforms
- Statistical feature selection and PCA dimensionality reduction
- Traditional algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression
- Reduced feature space (typically 20+ features ‚Üí 5-8 final features)

**Deep Learning Approach:**
- Minimal preprocessing with raw data input
- Simple MinMax normalization (0-1 scaling) only
- Multi-layer neural network with automatic feature learning
- Full feature space with network-learned representations

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Feature Filtering:** Remove metadata and high-cardinality features to prevent data leakage
2. **Class Balancing:** Equal sampling of normal and attack traffic for fair training
3. **Label Creation:** Automatic binary classification from category data (Normal vs Attack)
4. **Pipeline Consistency:** Same preprocessing applied to training and testing data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. "File not found" Error**
```
‚ùå File not found: training_datasets/UNSW_2018_Iot_Botnet_Dataset_2.csv
```
- **Solution:** Download the dataset files and place them in the correct `training_datasets/` folder
- **Check:** Verify the file name exactly matches what's in `data_handler.py`

**2. "Category column not found" Error**
```
‚ùå Category column not found!
```
- **Solution:** Ensure you downloaded the complete UNSW 2018 dataset with all 35 columns
- **Check:** The CSV should have 'category' and 'subcategory' as the last two columns

**3. Memory Issues with Large Datasets**
```
‚ùå Error loading dataset: Memory error
```
- **Solution:** The system automatically samples large datasets (>1M records) to manageable sizes
- **Alternative:** Use a smaller dataset file or increase your system's available RAM

**4. Perfect Accuracy (100%)**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Perfect accuracy detected - potential overfitting
```
- **Solution:** This indicates possible data leakage; the system includes warnings for this
- **Note:** Real-world performance should be 80-95%, not 100%

**5. Training Takes Too Long**
```
Training stuck at "Fitting model..."
```
- **Solution:** Reduce dataset size, use fewer epochs for DL, or try simpler ML algorithms
- **Recommended:** Start with 50k samples for initial testing

### Performance Expectations

**Normal Performance Ranges:**
- **Training Accuracy:** 85-95% (both ML and DL)
- **Testing Accuracy:** 80-92% (3-8% drop is normal)
- **Training Time:** 10-60 seconds for ML, 30-180 seconds for DL
- **Memory Usage:** 2-4GB RAM for full datasets

## Model Export and Deployment

Trained models are automatically stored in Streamlit session state with complete preprocessing pipelines. This ensures:
- **Consistent preprocessing** between training and production
- **Feature engineering pipeline preservation** for ML models
- **Neural network architecture preservation** for DL models
- **Ready for deployment** with proper input preprocessing

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a comprehensive, hands-on comparison of ML vs DL approaches for IoT botnet detection. The system demonstrates that:

1. **Traditional ML with feature engineering** often outperforms deep learning on structured network data
2. **Both approaches** can achieve production-viable detection rates (80-90%+)
3. **Proper evaluation methodology** (balanced training, unseen testing, data leakage prevention) is crucial for realistic results
4. **Real-world deployment** requires careful preprocessing pipeline management

The project serves as both a practical botnet detection tool and an educational platform for understanding the trade-offs between different machine learning approaches in cybersecurity applications.
